This includes all 146 CTA stations, having 383 entrances. The [CTA Rail Stations datasets](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?q=cta%20rail%20stations&sortBy=relevance) on the Chicago open data portal has a non-specific point representing the station, where the point often represents the centroid of the platform or station house. 

This dataset includes proposed entrances at under-construction stations: Wilson (Red & Purple Lines; there will be 3 entrances), Washington-Wabash (it's unknown where the entrances will actually be), and 95th Street (Red Line, 2 entrances).
