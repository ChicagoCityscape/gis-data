## Data

This includes all 146 CTA stations, having 383 entrances. The dataset on the Chicago open data portal has a non-specific point representing the station, where the point often represents the centroid of the platform or station house. 

This dataset includes proposed entrances at under-construction stations: Wilson, Washington-Wabash (which means that Madison/Wabash is permanently closed).
