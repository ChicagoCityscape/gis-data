One file is called "100 percent" and has every suspected coach house. 
The second file is called "77 percent" which is a subset of "100 percent" in which 23 percent of the coach houses have been removed at random, because of the quality control check I did against the "100 percent" file to see how many of the suspected coach houses were actual coach houses.
